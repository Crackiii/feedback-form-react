This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

This project is developed as a task for checkout.com. It's a simple Feedbacks system. A user can input thier name, email, rating and comment. Right away the feedbacks list will be updated, along with the daily trends of the feedbacks which shows how many feedbacks are given every single day.

## Techs and Tools

This project is built over `Vanilla Javascript (with ES6+)` features, `React JS` for front end rendering along with `Redux` for state management, `SCSS` pre-processor has been used for styling and `CSS modules` feature is used, which dynamically assigns classnames to the `JSX (HTML)` elements. `Node JS` has been used on the backend, with `MySQL` database and `Sequelize ORM`. Few more third party libraries are used for a good hand on, which are `Sweetalert` for showing nice popups with messages, `React-Star-Rating` library which gives good rating flexibility. 

## Configuration

Clone the repo through `git clone repo-link`.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
